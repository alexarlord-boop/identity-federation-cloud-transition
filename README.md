# CNFed - Cloud Native Federation ‚Äì Thesis Deployment Prototype

This repository contains the implementation of a federated identity infrastructure, developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis. It showcases how core components of a federation‚ÄîIdentity Providers (IdPs), Service Providers (SPs), and registry services‚Äîcan be deployed using modern DevOps practices with Kubernetes, Docker and Helm.

## üåê Overview

This prototype models a minimal but functional academic federation stack. It includes:

- **Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP)** with OpenLDAP
- **Shibboleth Service Provider (SP)** integration with SAML
- **Jagger Federation Registry (MDS)** for metadata management
- **OpenLDAP storage for users
- Kubernetes-native deployment (federation-stack with Helm)
